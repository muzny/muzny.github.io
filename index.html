                <p>
                    <strong>Fall 2025</strong> I am teaching <a href="cs4973.html">CS 4973: Mechanics and Philosophy of LLMs</a> 
                    in Fall 2025. This is a new large language models (without math or coding) course that <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/meica-danielle-magnani/"></a>Prof. Meica Magnani</a>
                    and I are co-teaching. It has no pre-requisites and is open to all students (not just Khoury majors).
                    Are you interested in taking it? Are your friends? Feel free to reach out to me or Meica with any questions!
                </p>
                <span class="badge bg-warning">Teaching Assistants</span>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fall 2025</strong> I do not currently expect to be hiring TAs for the courses I am teaching in Fall 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All questions related to TA logistics (time-sheets, etc.) should be answered via the TA Canvas
                    course. If you have questions about synchronous TA training, please read the instructions on the TA
                    Canvas course, then reach out to me if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always welcome emails from students about the TA program/TAing (as opposed to emails that are sending me resumes).
                    When hiring TAs for my own courses, I do not respond to resumes submitted via email. All applications, including resumes should
                    be submitted via the Khoury admin portal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also recommend that you reach out to your peers and get some on-the-ground perspective!

                <p>
                    In general, if you are interested in working on a research project with me, be sure to include
                    thoughts about the kinds of projects you'd like to work on, how it might match up to work that I do
                    currently, and why you are reaching out to me specifically. My current research projects focus on
                    broadening participation in computing, TA development, and the intersection of CS education and AI/NLP.
                    I tend to not respond to "boiler plate" research or TA inquiries.

                <span class="badge bg-info">Students</span>
                <p>
                    If you are a current or incoming Northeastern student interested in taking a course with me and
                    there is no space available, reach out to your academic advisor (I have no power over course sizes
                    or waitlists)!
                </p>

                <p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! </br>
                I am an associate teaching professor and the Director of Teaching Assistants in Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern
                University in Boston.
                <!-- I have facilitated our faculty Broading Participation in Computing reading group along with <a
                    href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/laney/">Laney Strange</a>. -->
                Previously, I was an instructor in the Computer Science department at the University of Colorado,
                Boulder.
            </p>

            <p>
                I do research in computing education, digital humanities, and in the intersections of sociology, ethics,
                and computing. I am currently working with the <a href="https://cic.northeastern.edu/">Center for
                    Inclusive Computing</a>, and was supervised by <a
                    href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/carla-brodley/">Carla E. Brodley</a>. I am also
                affiliated faculty with the <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/">NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science</a>.

            </p>

            <p>
                In the past, I worked with the <a href="https://www.playfulcomputation.group/">Laboratory for Playful
                    Computation</a> at CU Boulder. When I was a graduate student at Stanford, I was a part of the <a
                    href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/">Natural Language Processing</a> group and the <a
                    href="https://litlab.stanford.edu/">Literary Lab</a> with <a
                    href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> and <a
                    href="https://english.stanford.edu/people/mark-algee-hewitt">Mark Algee-Hewitt</a>.

            <p>
                Before that, I studied English Literature and Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle
                and worked on automatic idiom identification with <a
                    href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz">Luke Zettlemoyer</a>.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I am involved in the activities of the local Out in Tech chapter, and always happy to respond to student
                and colleague inquiries regarding the intersections of CS, AI, ethics, and queer/trans issues.
