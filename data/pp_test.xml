<chapter>CHAPTER XIX (19)

THE next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.

On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast,<mention connection="s928" id="s951" speaker="Mr_Collins"> he</mention> addressed the mother in these words, <quote connection="s951" id="s928" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?&quot;</quote>

Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, <mention connection="s929" id="s952" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> instantly answered, <quote connection="s952" id="s929" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh dear! -- Yes -- certainly. -- I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection. -- Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.&quot;</quote>

And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when <mention connection="s930" id="s953" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> called out, <quote connection="s953" id="s930" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Dear Ma'am, do not go. -- I beg you will not go. -- Mr. Collins must excuse me. -- He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.  I am going away myself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s954" id="s931" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. -- I desire you will stay where you are.&quot;</quote> -- And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, <mention connection="s931,s932" id="s954" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s954" id="s932" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone <mention connection="s933" id="s955" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention> began.

<quote connection="s955" id="s933" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.&quot;</quote>

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and <mention connection="s934" id="s956" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention> continued: <quote connection="s956" id="s934" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.  Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier -- that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry. -- Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is my advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'  Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.  Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place -- which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.  This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.&quot;</quote>

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

<quote connection="s957" id="s935" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are too hasty, Sir,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s935,s936" id="s957" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> cried.  <quote connection="s957" id="s936" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You forget that I have made no answer.  Let me do it without farther loss of time.  Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me, I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s958" id="s937" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I am not now to learn,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s937,s938" id="s958" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>, with a formal wave of the hand, <quote connection="s958" id="s938" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.  I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s959" id="s939" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Upon my word, Sir,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s939,s940,s943" id="s959" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s959" id="s940" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal. -- You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so, -- Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s960" id="s941" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s941,s942" id="s960" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention> very gravely -- <quote connection="s960" id="s942" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s959" id="s943" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.&quot;</quote>

And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not <mention connection="s944" id="s961" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention> thus addressed her, <quote connection="s961" id="s944" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s962" id="s945" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Really,<mention connection="s947" id="s963" speaker="Mr_Collins"> Mr. Collins</mention>,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s945,s946,s948" id="s962" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> with some warmth, <quote connection="s962" id="s946" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;you puzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s963" id="s947" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: -- It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in its favor; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s962" id="s948" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.  I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.  I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My feelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s965" id="s949" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;You are uniformly charming!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s949,s950" id="s965" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, with an air of awkward gallantry; <quote connection="s965" id="s950" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.&quot;</quote>

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception, Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

<chapter>CHAPTER XX (20)

MR. COLLINS was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had stedfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; -- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.

<quote connection="s1000" id="s967" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s967,s968" id="s1000" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1000" id="s968" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it myself directly.  She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1001" id="s969" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s969,s970" id="s1001" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>; <quote connection="s1001" id="s970" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1002" id="s971" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Sir, you quite misunderstand me,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s971,s972" id="s1002" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, alarmed. <quote connection="s1002" id="s972" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s973" id="s1003" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">She</mention> would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, <quote connection="s1003" id="s973" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.  You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.

<quote connection="s1004" id="s974" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I have not the pleasure of understanding you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s974,s975,s977,s979" id="s1004" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, when <mention connection="s976,s978" id="s1005" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> had finished her speech.  <quote connection="s1004" id="s975" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Of what are you talking?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1005" id="s976" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1004" id="s977" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;And what am I to do on the occasion? -- It seems an hopeless business.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1005" id="s978" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1004" id="s979" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.

<quote connection="s1006" id="s980" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Come here, child,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s980,s981,s982" id="s1006" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her father</mention> as she appeared.  <quote connection="s1006" id="s981" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I have sent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?&quot;</quote>  <mention connection="s983" id="s1007" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> replied that it was.  <quote connection="s1006" id="s982" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1007" id="s983" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I have, <mention connection="s984,s986" id="s1008" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Sir</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1008" id="s984" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists upon your accepting it.  Is not it so, <mention connection="s985" id="s1009" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1009" id="s985" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Yes, or I will never see her again.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1008" id="s986" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. -- Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but <mention connection="s987" id="s1010" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

<quote connection="s1010" id="s987" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?  You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1011" id="s988" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;My dear,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s988,s989" id="s1011" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her husband</mention>, <quote connection="s1011" id="s989" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I have two small favours to request.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.&quot;</quote>

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering; -- and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by <mention connection="s990" id="s1012" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, <quote connection="s1012" id="s990" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! -- What do you think has happened this morning? -- Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.&quot;</quote>

Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.  <quote connection="s1013" id="s991" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s991,s992" id="s1013" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> added in a melancholy tone, <quote connection="s1013" id="s992" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.&quot;</quote>

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

<quote connection="s1014" id="s993" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Aye, there she comes,&quot;</quote> continued <mention connection="s993,s994" id="s1014" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s1014" id="s994" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. -- But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. -- _I_ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you. -- I have done with you from this very day. -- I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children, -- Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.  People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer! -- But it is always so.  Those who do not complain are never pitied.&quot;</quote>

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.

She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, <mention connection="s995" id="s1015" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> said to the girls, <quote connection="s1015" id="s995" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice <mention connection="s996" id="s1016" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> thus began the projected conversation. -- <quote connection="s1016" id="s996" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  Mr. Collins!&quot;</quote> --

<quote connection="s1017" id="s997" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;My dear Madam,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s997,s998" id="s1017" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s1017" id="s998" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;let us be for ever silent on this point.  Far be it from me,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s999" id="s1018" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention> presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, <quote connection="s1018" id="s999" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;to resent the behaviour of your daughter.  Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.  Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to error.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.&quot;</quote>

THE discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over. -- To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.

<quote connection="s1049" id="s1020" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I found,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1020,s1021" id="s1049" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention>, <quote connection="s1049" id="s1021" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; -- that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.&quot;</quote>

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.

When they had gained their own room, <mention connection="s1022,s1026" id="s1050" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> taking out the letter, said, <quote connection="s1050" id="s1022" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.  The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.  You shall hear what <mention connection="s1023" id="s1051" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she </mention>says.&quot;</quote>

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these words.  <quote connection="s1051" id="s1023" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.&quot;</quote> To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

<quote connection="s1052" id="s1024" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It is unlucky,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1024,s1025,s1030" id="s1052" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, after a short pause, <quote connection="s1052" id="s1025" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.  But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? -- Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1050" id="s1026" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s1027,s1032" id="s1053" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Caroline</mention> decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you --&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1053" id="s1027" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1054" id="s1028" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;It is evident by this,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1028,s1029,s1031" id="s1054" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1054" id="s1029" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;that he comes back no more this winter.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1052" id="s1030" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1054" id="s1031" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing. -- He is his own master.  But you do not know _all_.  I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves from _you_.&quot;</quote>  <quote connection="s1053" id="s1032" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1055" id="s1033" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear <mention connection="s1035,s1037,s1038,s1041" id="s1056" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>?&quot;</quote> -- said <mention connection="s1033,s1034,s1036" id="s1055" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> as she finished it.  <quote connection="s1055" id="s1034" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Is it not clear enough? -- Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can there be any other opinion on the subject?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1056" id="s1035" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. -- Will you hear it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1055" id="s1036" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Most willingly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1056" id="s1037" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You shall have it in few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.&quot;</quote>

Jane shook her head.

<quote connection="s1056" id="s1038" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. -- No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this.  We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1057" id="s1039" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1039,s1040,s1042" id="s1057" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1057" id="s1040" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.  But I know the foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1056" id="s1041" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is right. -- You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be deceived by all means.  You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1057" id="s1042" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1058" id="s1043" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You must decide for yourself,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1043,s1044,s1047" id="s1058" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1058" id="s1044" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1059" id="s1045" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;How can you talk so?&quot;</quote> -- said <mention connection="s1045,s1046,s1048" id="s1059" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> faintly smiling, -- <quote connection="s1059" id="s1046" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1058" id="s1047" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I did not think you would; -- and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1059" id="s1048" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.  A thousand things may arise in six months!&quot;</quote>

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.  Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.

<chapter>CHAPTER XXII (22)

THE Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.  Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  <quote connection="s1075" id="s1061" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It keeps him in good humour,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1061,s1062" id="s1075" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1075" id="s1062" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&quot;</quote>  Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; -- its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.  His reception however was of the most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's.  The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The younger girls formed hopes of _coming_ _out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections were in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.  But still, he would be her husband. -- Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.  This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.  She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.

<quote connection="s1076" id="s1063" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;My dear Madam,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1063,s1064" id="s1076" speaker="Mr_Collins">he </mention>replied, <quote connection="s1076" id="s1064" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.&quot;</quote>

They were all astonished; and <mention connection="s1065,s1068" id="s1077" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet,</mention> who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, <quote connection="s1077" id="s1065" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? -- You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1078" id="s1066" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;My dear sir,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1066,s1067,s1069" id="s1078" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>, <quote connection="s1078" id="s1067" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1077" id="s1068" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You cannot be too much on your guard.  Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1078" id="s1069" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.&quot;</quote>

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and <mention connection="s1070" id="s1079" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> could not help crying out, <quote connection="s1079" id="s1070" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Engaged to Mr. Collins!  my dear Charlotte, -- impossible!&quot;</quote>

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, <mention connection="s1071" id="s1080" speaker="Charlotte">she</mention> soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, <quote connection="s1080" id="s1071" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? -- Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?&quot;</quote>

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.

<quote connection="s1081" id="s1072" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I see what you are feeling,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1072,s1073" id="s1081" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, -- <quote connection="s1081" id="s1073" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;you must be surprised, very much surprised, -- so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am not romantic, you know.  I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1074" id="s1082" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth </mention>quietly answered <quote connection="s1082" id="s1074" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Undoubtedly;&quot;</quote> -- and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.  The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.  Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture! -- And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.

__</chapter>
<chapter>CHAPTER XXIII (23)

ELIZABETH was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.

With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, -- to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and <mention connection="s1084" id="s1094" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, <quote connection="s1094" id="s1084" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Good Lord!  Sir William, how can you tell such a story? -- Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?&quot;</quote>

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could console and nothing appease her. -- Nor did that day wear out her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. -- It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. -- She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.  Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.  Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.  The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.  The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.  As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

<quote connection="s1095" id="s1085" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Indeed, <mention connection="s1087,s1089" id="s1096" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1085,s1086" id="s1095" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1095" id="s1086" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1096" id="s1087" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us hope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.&quot;</quote>

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, <mention connection="s1088,s1090,s1092" id="s1097" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> went on as before, <quote connection="s1097" id="s1088" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate, If it was not for the entail I should not mind it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1096" id="s1089" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;What should not you mind?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1097" id="s1090" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I should not mind any thing at all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1099" id="s1091" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1097" id="s1092" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I never can be thankful, <mention connection="s1091" id="s1099" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, for any thing about the entail.  How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! -- Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1098" id="s1093" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I leave it to yourself to determine,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1093" id="s1098" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>.

END OF VOL. I                               __

VOLUME II</chapter>
<chapter>CHAPTER I (24)

MISS Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.  Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.  Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as, she thought, he must be sensible himself.  It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before <mention connection="s1101" id="s1130" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, <quote connection="s1130" id="s1101" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.

<quote connection="s1131" id="s1102" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;You doubt me,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1102,s1103" id="s1131" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, slightly colouring; <quote connection="s1131" id="s1103" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;indeed you have no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.  A little time therefore. -- I shall certainly try to get the better.&quot;</quote>

With a stronger voice <mention connection="s1104" id="s1132" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention> soon added, <quote connection="s1132" id="s1104" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1133" id="s1105" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My dear Jane!&quot;</quote> exclaimed <mention connection="s1105,s1106" id="s1133" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1133" id="s1106" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.

<quote connection="s1134" id="s1107" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Nay,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1107,s1108" id="s1134" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1134" id="s1108" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;this is not fair.  _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.  _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.  Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.  You need not.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.  The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.  I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.  It is unaccountable!  in every view it is unaccountable!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1144" id="s1109" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My dear <mention connection="s1110" id="s1135" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.  Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1135" id="s1110" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.  My dear <mention connection="s1109" id="s1144" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1136" id="s1111" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1111,s1112,s1114,s1117,s1119" id="s1136" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1136" id="s1112" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to something else.  You mentioned two instances.  I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear <mention connection="s1113" id="s1137" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, not to pain me by thinking _that_ _person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.  It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration means more than it does.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1137" id="s1113" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And men take care that they should.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1136" id="s1114" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1138" id="s1115" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1115,s1116,s1118,s1120,s1122" id="s1138" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1138" id="s1116" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1136" id="s1117" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;And do you impute it to either of those?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1138" id="s1118" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.  Stop me whilst you can.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1136" id="s1119" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1138" id="s1120" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, in conjunction with his friend.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1139" id="s1121" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1138" id="s1122" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1139" id="s1123" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1123,s1124,s1121" id="s1139" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>; <quote connection="s1139" id="s1124" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.  They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.  What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?  If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  <quote connection="s1141" id="s1125" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;So, <mention connection="s1127" id="s1143" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1125,s1126" id="s1141" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention> one day, <quote connection="s1141" id="s1126" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.  It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to come?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is your time.  Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be _your_ man.  He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1143" id="s1127" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1142" id="s1128" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;True,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1128,s1129" id="s1142" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s1142" id="s1129" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.  The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

__</chapter>
<chapter>CHAPTER II (25)

AFTER a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.  They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done, she had a less active part to play.  It became her turn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.

<quote connection="s1160" id="s1146" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I do not blame Jane,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1146,s1147" id="s1160" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> continued, <quote connection="s1160" id="s1147" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could.  But, Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for what they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.  <quote connection="s1162" id="s1148" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1148,s1149,s1152,s1154" id="s1162" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">she</mention>.  <quote connection="s1162" id="s1149" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen so often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1163" id="s1150" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;An excellent consolation in its way,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1150,s1151" id="s1163" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1163" id="s1151" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but it will not do for _us_.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1162" id="s1152" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent_ _was_ Mr. Bingley's love?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1166" id="s1153" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I never saw a more promising inclination.  He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer.  Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility the very essence of love?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1162" id="s1154" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;Oh, yes! -- of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.  Poor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to _you_, <mention connection="s1153" id="s1166" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.  But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?  Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1157,s1159" id="s1167" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.

<quote connection="s1164" id="s1155" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;I hope,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1155,s1156" id="s1164" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>, <quote connection="s1164" id="s1156" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1167" id="s1157" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London -- !  <mention connection="s1158" id="s1165" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">My dear aunt</mention>, how could you think of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1165" id="s1158" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does not Jane correspond with the sister?  _She_ will not be able to help calling.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1167" id="s1159" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;She will drop the acquaintance entirely.&quot;</quote>

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.

The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.  Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.  Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.

__</chapter>
<chapter>CHAPTER III (26)

MRS. GARDINER'S caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, <mention connection="s1169" id="s1192" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">she</mention> thus went on: <quote connection="s1192" id="s1169" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;You are too sensible a girl, <mention connection="s1170" id="s1193" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.  Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.  I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not disappoint your father.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1193" id="s1170" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s1171,s1173" id="s1194" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">My dear aunt</mention>, this is being serious indeed.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1194" id="s1171" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1195" id="s1172" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1194" id="s1173" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;<mention connection="s1172,s1174" id="s1195" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, you are not serious now.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1195" id="s1174" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I beg your pardon.  I will try again.  At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not.  I see the imprudence of it. -- Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! -- My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honor; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, <mention connection="s1175" id="s1197" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">my dear aunt</mention>, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.  In short, I will do my best.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1197" id="s1175" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.  At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1196" id="s1176" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;As I did the other day,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1176,s1177" id="s1196" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, with a conscious smile; <quote connection="s1196" id="s1177" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.  But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied.&quot;</quote>

Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that <mention connection="s1178" id="s1198" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> <quote connection="s1198" id="s1178" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;_wished_ they might be happy.&quot;</quote> Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.

As they went down stairs together, <mention connection="s1179,s1181,s1183" id="s1199" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention> said, <quote connection="s1199" id="s1179" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I shall depend on hearing from you very often, <mention connection="s1180,s1182" id="s1200" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Eliza</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1200" id="s1180" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;_That_ you certainly shall.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1199" id="s1181" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;And I have another favour to ask.  Will you come and see me?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1200" id="s1182" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1199" id="s1183" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.

<quote connection="s1201" id="s1184" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;My father and Maria are to come to me in March,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1184,s1185" id="s1201" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, <quote connection="s1201" id="s1185" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them.&quot;</quote>

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.  Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.

<quote connection="s1202" id="s1186" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My aunt,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1186,s1187" id="s1202" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention> continued, <quote connection="s1202" id="s1187" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street.&quot;</quote>

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.  <quote connection="s1203" id="s1188" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I did not think Caroline in spirits,&quot;</quote> were <mention connection="s1188,s1189" id="s1203" speaker="Jane_Bennet">her words</mention>, <quote connection="s1203" id="s1189" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.  I enquired after their brother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say I shall soon see them here.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.  The letter which <mention connection="s1190" id="s1204" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention> wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.

<quote connection="s1204" id="s1190" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.  I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it, I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.  But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy: your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from you very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.

Your's, &amp;c.&quot;</quote>

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.  She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.  His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.  Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.  The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, <mention connection="s1191" id="s1205" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> thus went on: -- <quote connection="s1205" id="s1191" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain.&quot;</quote>
